## Election Audit Summary

This script, with some modifications, can be used for any election. As is, it is able to break down election results by candidate, as well as by county. For larger elections that may just look at the popular vote for entire states, the county portion of the script can be changed to reflect state results. If you wanted to audit election results by county to determine how a candidate won a state, then you would keep the county portion of the script and add a state results section as well.
